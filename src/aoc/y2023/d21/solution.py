    # My approach for Part 2 differs from Part 1 in two notable ways:
    #   1. we treat the garden as toroidal ("infinite")
    #   2. we numerically extrapolate the plots at step n rather than simulate it
    #
    # To extrapolate the plots at step n, we calculate the polynomial using samples we
    # observe through a similar simlulation we used for Part 1. But there are lots
    # of finicky details:
    #
    #   - Not just any polynomial, but a second-degree polynomial -- aka a quadratic.
    #   - Why quadratic? Well, when the samples are plotted with Google Sheets and then
    #     annotated with a trendline, the second-degree polynomial fits perfectly.
    #   - Also, when I got stuck, r/adventofcode confirmed it was quadratic.
    #   - Also, I'm sure there is a more substantive reason it's quadratic based on the
    #     geometry of the problem, but meh. Applied wins over pure for me in this case.
    #   - To calculate the quadratic polynomial, we need three points. (Because math.)
    #   - A subtlety, though, is that the polynomial won't come out right if you choose
    #     _any_ three points. The strategy (which I shamelessly lifted from the experts
    #     on r/adventofcode) is to choose the center points (aka "start" position) of
    #     each repeated grid.
    #   - Since the puzzle input has a clear, unobstructed path to the east and west
    #     of the start point, the idea is that we can know exactly how many steps
    #     it takes to get to the next center point without hitting any rocks. Note that
    #     this is a unique oddity of the puzzle input that isn't found in the examples.
    #   - Further, since each repeated grid is the same as all others (hence,
    #     "repeated"), steps from the center point of any grid should observe the same
    #     behavior as the original grid.
    #   - In fact, if we sample at any other points, we'll get a different (and wrong)
    #     polynomial that won't give us the right answer. (Because rocks.)
    #   - Given a grid of size (131, 131), the midpoint is (65, 65).
    #   - Given a repeated grid of size (131, 131), the midpoints of grid (m, n) are
    #     periodic and given by (131m + 65, 131n + 65).
    #   - So, we'll sample our simulation at steps (65, 196, 327), all of which are
    #     small enough to be simulated in reasonable time using our Part 1 approach
    #     (now modded for toroidal coordinates).
    #   - Then we'll plug those samples into quadratic polynomial fit function -- I
    #     used NumPy, for simplicity) and evaluate the polynomial for our answer.
    #   - The final gotcha (that had me stuck for _hours_) is that the polynomial fit
    #     is unstable and highly sensitive to your choice of x-coordinates and which
    #     NumPy polynomial routine you use. I only got the correct rounded answer
    #     when using _periods_, not steps, with the np.polynomial.polyfit function.
    #       - BAD:  [(26501365, y) | (65, y1), (196, y2), (327, y3)]
    #       - GOOD: [(  202300, y) | ( 0, y1), (  1, y2), (  2, y3)]
    #     np.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.fit returned an off-by-one answer.
    #   - "But wait," you ask, "where did that 202300 come from?" Haha. Well, 202300
    #     is the number of periods for 26501365 -- (26501365 âˆ’ 65) / 131 == 202300.
    #   - And, of course, this means that this approach (which works for the puzzle
    #     input) won't work for the example input.
    #
    # And there you go. Thank you to the many folks on r/adventofcode who dropped
    # enough useful clues for me to figure this one out. I wouldn't have solved Part 2
    # on my own without them.
